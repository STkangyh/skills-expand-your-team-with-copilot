## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Adding Tasks
```javascript
// Example of adding a high-priority task
const newTask = {
    text: "Implement GitHub Copilot integration",
    priority: "high",
    completed: false
};
```

### Filtering Tasks
- **All Tasks**: View complete task list
- **Pending**: Show only incomplete tasks
- **Completed**: Display finished tasks only

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`: Focus on task input
- `Escape`: Clear task input and unfocus
- `Enter`: Submit new task (when input is focused)

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Features
The codebase is designed to be easily extensible. Here are some ideas:

1. **Due Dates**: Add deadline functionality
2. **Categories**: Implement task categorization
3. **Team Members**: Assign tasks to specific people
4. **Export/Import**: Add data export capabilities
5. **Dark Mode**: Implement theme switching

### Styling Customization
Modify `styles.css` to customize:
- Color schemes and gradients
- Typography and spacing
- Animation timings
- Responsive breakpoints

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts
